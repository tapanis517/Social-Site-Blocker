 a framework
for the detection of vehicular accidents is proposed. 
framework uses Mask R-CNN for object detection and
an object tracking algorithm  on dashcam videos. The
chances of an accident happening are decided based on a
set of anomalies that are determined in a vehicle when it
overlaps with another vehicle in the footage. 

 A
key objective is to give a basic yet efficient method for solving
the problem of vehicular accident detection which can work
productively and give crucial data to paramedical services and
concerned authorities immediately. The outlined model is an
extension of our research conducted in a similar domain but
on CCTV camera footage [11]. Change of angle of view in
dashcam poses a new set of challenges and we have modified
our approach tackling the same.
